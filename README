PenguinTV

Thank you for downloading Penguin TV.  This application is an RSS feed reader with support for enclosed media.  You can watch video blogs and listen to podcasts with this application.  See the website for new features and fixes in this version.

== Requirements ==

PenguinTV is a python program, and requires python version 2.3 or higher.  It also requires several libraries and their python versions:

* gnome 2.x 
* pysqlite version 2 or greater (http://pysqlite.org/)
* pycurl version 7.11 or greater (http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/)
* mozilla support for python (gnome-python2-gtkmozembed or python-gnome2-extras)

== Optional Libraries ==

PenguinTV supports some other extra libraries but will run without them:

* python-gstreamer for internal media playback

== Installing ==

Installation should be as simple as running

python setup.py install

as root.  Please email me if you have trouble installing the program.

the autotools files (autogen.sh, configure.ac, etc) are for OLPC ONLY.  They are not needed for regular penguintv installations.

== Running PenguinTV ==

PenguinTV will be installed in GNOME menus under Internet

If you do not have python-gstreamer installed, PenguinTV will use the GNOME or KDE default media player to open downloaded files.

If you want to use PenguinTV to transfer files to a portable media player, you can use the Go / Synchronize Media command.

== Crashes == 

PenguinTV uses the same Mozilla technology as Firefox to display your RSS feeds.  Unfortunately there are bugs in the way some distributions have created these packages which cause PenguinTV to crash.  If PenguinTV crashes on your machine (for instance, if you get a "segmentation fault" or if a window pops up telling you the program crashed), I'd like to know about it.

== Development ==

Please email me at owen-penguintv@ywwg.com with questions, comments, or suggestions.  I would welcome help on packaging, translation, or making PenguinTV work better for you. 

Thanks for watching,
Owen Williams
