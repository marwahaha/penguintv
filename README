PenguinTV

Thank you for downloading Penguin TV.  This application is an RSS feed reader with support for enclosed media.  You can watch video blogs and listen to podcasts with this application.  See the website for new features and fixes in this version.

WARNING: This project is mostly abandoned.  I still use it, though, and occasionally fix bugs that I find, so it should still work.

== Requirements ==

PenguinTV is a python program, and requires python version 2.5 or higher.  It also requires several libraries and their python versions:

* gnome 2.x
* python 2.5 or later
* pycurl version 7.11 or greater (http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/)
* mozilla support for python (gnome-python2-gtkmozembed or python-gnome2-extras)
* python imaging library (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

== Optional Libraries ==

PenguinTV supports some other extra libraries but will run without them:

* python-gstreamer for internal media playback
* python-xapian for search support

== Building ==

Build with:
python setup.py build

Building on maemo:
inside scratchbox, run ./build_maemo_deb.sh to build a debian package
This will also build gtkmozembed support for python for inclusion in the package

== Running without Installing ==

after you've built penguintv, you can type
./bin/PenguinTV 
to run the program

== Installing ==

Installation should be as simple as running

python setup.py install

as root.  Please email me if you have trouble installing the program.

== Running PenguinTV ==

PenguinTV will be installed in GNOME menus under Internet

If you do not have python-gstreamer installed, PenguinTV will use the GNOME or KDE default media player to open downloaded files.

If you want to use PenguinTV to transfer files to a portable media player, you can use the Go / Synchronize Media command.

== Crashes == 

PenguinTV uses the same Mozilla technology as Firefox to display your RSS feeds.  Unfortunately there are bugs in the way some distributions have created these packages which cause PenguinTV to crash.  If PenguinTV crashes on your machine (for instance, if you get a "segmentation fault" or if a window pops up telling you the program crashed), I'd like to know about it.

== Development ==

please don't get involved :P

Thanks for watching,
Owen Williams
