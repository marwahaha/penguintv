The News Reader has transitioned over to "NewsReaderLite," a rewrite of the
user interface that is much more appropriate for the laptop.  Among other
improvements, the reader now starts up much faster, uses less memory, can
safely open multiple instances, and is session-aware.  Soon it will be possible
to share reader sessions.  I hope to completely implement the design guidelines
in bug 2725 by the end of the week and push the new activity out for Trial-3.
